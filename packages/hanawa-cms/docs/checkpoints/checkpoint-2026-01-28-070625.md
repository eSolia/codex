The conversation transcript you provided contains only a queue dequeue operation with no actual work performed. Both previous checkpoints from today (01-28) note the same pattern.

Since there's no substantive session to checkpoint, I have two observations:

1. **No work to summarize** - The transcript is a single queue operation, not a coding session.
2. **Existing checkpoints already cover today** - There are already two checkpoints from 2026-01-28.

If you'd like me to create a checkpoint summarizing the **cumulative work across today's sessions** based on git history and the existing checkpoints, I can do that. Otherwise, if you have a specific session transcript with actual work, please share it and I'll generate the checkpoint from that.

Would you like me to proceed with a cumulative summary of today's work instead?
