I've prepared a checkpoint summary. Since there was no substantive work in the conversation transcript (only a queue operation event), the checkpoint reflects that this was a session initialization with no tasks completed.

Here's the checkpoint content I generated:

# Checkpoint Summary - 2026-01-16

## Session Overview

This session was initialized but no substantive work was performed. The conversation transcript contains only a queue operation (dequeue) event indicating session start.

## Key Technical Decisions

None made in this session.

## Files Modified

None modified in this session.

## Problems Solved

None - session just began.

## Next Steps

Based on uncommitted changes visible in git status, potential follow-up work includes:

- **Fragment import updates**: `fragments-import.sql` and `scripts/import-fragments.ts` have modifications
- **Mermaid block improvements**: `src/lib/editor/extensions/mermaid-block.ts` has changes
- **Document page updates**: `src/routes/documents/[id]/+page.server.ts` modified
- **Fragment page enhancements**: `src/routes/fragments/[id]/+page.svelte` has updates
- **Diagram upload feature**: New files in `src/routes/api/diagrams/upload/` (untracked)
- **Configuration updates**: `wrangler.jsonc` has modifications
- **New checkpoints**: Several checkpoint files need to be committed
