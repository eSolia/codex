I see there's already a checkpoint from earlier today, and the conversation transcript you provided only contains a queue operation with no actual work done. This appears to be a fresh session start.

Looking at the git status and recent commits, I can see there's been significant work on:

- PDF Japanese font rendering fixes
- Client personalization feature for documents
- Version bump to 0.3.2

However, since this specific conversation has no technical work to summarize, I can offer two options:

1. **If you want a checkpoint of recent project work** (based on git history and existing checkpoints), I can create one that summarizes the PDF and personalization work from recent commits.

2. **If this is truly a new session**, there's nothing to checkpoint yet - we can proceed with whatever task you'd like to work on.

Which would you prefer? Or if there was work in a previous session you'd like me to capture, please share that context.
