## eSolia Pool

Pre-purchased blocks of support hours that give you flexible, on-demand access to eSolia's professional services beyond your fixed agreement.

**What Is a Pool?**

A Pool is a bank of support hours purchased in advance and attached to your service contract. Draw down hours as needed throughout the year for ad hoc requests, extra on-site visits, or any work outside your regular agreement scope.

**Available Sizes**

| Pool | Hours |
|------|-------|
| Small | 50 |
| Medium | 100 |
| Standard | 200 |
| Large | 400 |
| Enterprise | 600 |

**How It Works**

- Purchase a pool at a discounted per-hour rate compared to ad hoc billing
- Pool is valid for one year from the month of first use
- Hours are debited based on work performed, using a unit-based rate system
- Different roles consume hours at different rates (e.g. senior consultant time costs more units per hour than assistant time)
- Monthly reporting shows hours consumed, remaining balance, and a running tally
- When your pool is exhausted, it can be replenished with a new block

**Unit-Based Rate System**

Each role has a unit value per hour. Higher-skilled roles consume more units, reflecting their expertise:

- **Senior Consultant** — highest unit rate per hour
- **Engineer** — moderate unit rate per hour
- **Assistant** — lowest unit rate per hour

This means a pool covers more assistant hours than consultant hours, giving you flexibility in how you allocate the time.

**What Pools Cover**

- Ad hoc remote support requests outside your regular agreement
- Additional on-site visit hours beyond your contracted schedule
- Short-duration projects or investigations
- Temporary surge capacity during busy periods
- Specialized consulting or advisory sessions

**Monthly Reporting**

Each month you receive a clear report alongside your regular service summary:

- Hours used this period, broken down by role type
- Running balance of remaining hours
- Projected depletion timeline based on current usage trends

**Why Use a Pool?**

- **Predictable costs** — lock in a discounted rate for the year
- **Flexibility** — use hours when and how you need them
- **No waste** — hours are consumed only when work is performed
- **Transparency** — monthly tracking keeps you informed
- **Budget-friendly** — avoid surprise ad hoc invoices

Pools complement your fixed support agreement, ensuring you always have professional IT assistance available when unexpected needs arise.
