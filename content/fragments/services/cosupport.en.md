## eSolia Co-Support

Work alongside your existing IT team. Co-Support provides flexible, on-demand IT expertise to augment your internal capabilities — filling gaps, handling overflow, and bringing specialized skills when you need them.

**What You Get**

- Access to eSolia's bilingual engineering team (EN/JA)
- Skill augmentation for areas your team lacks coverage
- Overflow and surge capacity for busy periods
- After-hours and vacation backup coverage
- Specialized project expertise on demand
- Knowledge transfer to strengthen your internal team

**How It Works**

- Request-based, flexible engagement — scale up or down as needed
- Blended rate structure for simplicity
- Monthly review meeting with your IT leadership
- Shared ticketing for transparency and coordination
- Your team stays in control; we support where needed
- On-site, remote, or hybrid delivery

**Ideal For**

- Organizations with an existing IT team that needs additional capacity
- Companies whose IT staff lack specific skills (e.g., networking, security, cloud)
- Teams that need reliable backup for leaves, transitions, or emergencies
- Businesses undergoing IT transformation who need temporary expertise
- IT managers who want a trusted partner rather than a replacement

**Outcomes**

- Stronger internal team through knowledge transfer
- Flexible costs — pay for what you use
- Reduced single-point-of-failure risk for key IT personnel
- Access to broad expertise without hiring specialists
- Smooth handoffs and continuity during staff changes

Co-Support clients benefit from eSolia's deep bench of experienced engineers across infrastructure, cloud, security, and end-user computing — all with the bilingual, Japan-market expertise that makes the difference.
