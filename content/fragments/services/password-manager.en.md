We recommend implementing a team password manager (1Password or Bitwarden)
to eliminate password reuse and enable secure credential sharing. This is
one of the highest-impact security improvements any small team can make.

**Key Benefits:**
- Unique, strong passwords for every service
- Secure sharing of credentials among team members
- Protection against phishing (autofill only works on legitimate sites)
- Audit trail of credential access
- Emergency access procedures for business continuity
