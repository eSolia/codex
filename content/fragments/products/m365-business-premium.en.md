**Full Office Applications:** The license includes perpetual desktop
versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook—replacing whatever
came with your laptops with properly licensed, always-updated software.

**Business Email:** Professional email hosting with your company domain,
plus calendars, contacts, and Microsoft Teams for collaboration.

**Defender Protection:** Microsoft Defender is included, providing:

- Antivirus and anti-malware scanning across all devices
- Anti-phishing protection that scans email links and attachments before you open them
- Safe Links that check URLs at the moment you click, blocking newly-discovered threats
- Safe Attachments that open files in a protected sandbox to detect hidden malware
- Device security policies that ensure laptops and phones meet security standards

These Defender features are typically only available in Microsoft's expensive
enterprise licenses. Business Premium includes them at a mid-tier price.
