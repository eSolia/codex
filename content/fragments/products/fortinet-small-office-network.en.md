## Small Office Network — Fortinet

A compact, professional-grade network for your office built on Fortinet's integrated security platform. This setup gives a small office the same caliber of network infrastructure used by larger organizations, right-sized for your environment.

**FortiWifi — Firewall, Router, and Wireless Access Point**

The FortiWifi is an all-in-one device that serves as your firewall, router, and wireless access point. Your team connects to Wi-Fi directly through it, with enterprise-grade security applied to all traffic — web filtering, intrusion prevention, and application control included. It is managed through Fortinet's FortiCloud or FortiGate interface, giving your parent organization visibility and policy consistency across locations.

**FortiSwitch — Managed Network Switching**

The FortiSwitch provides high-performance wired connectivity for devices that need it — desktops, printers, IP phones, and other equipment. Managed directly from the FortiWifi, the switch requires no separate management interface, keeping administration simple. VLANs, QoS, and port security are configured centrally, so your network segmentation aligns with your organization's standards.

**Structured Cabling**

A clean, professional cabling installation using high-quality Category 6A or better cabling, properly terminated patch panels, and neat cable management. Good structured cabling is the foundation of a reliable network — it eliminates the intermittent connectivity issues and performance problems that come from ad-hoc cabling. All runs are tested and certified.

**Compact Rack and UPS**

All equipment is housed in a small wall-mount or floor-standing rack, keeping everything organized, ventilated, and physically secure. A rack-mount UPS protects against power interruptions, giving the network equipment enough runtime to ride through brief outages and shut down gracefully during longer ones.

**Why This Combination Works**

- Unified management — FortiSwitch is managed from FortiWifi, one interface for the whole network
- Security built in — not bolted on after the fact
- Consistent with larger Fortinet deployments your parent organization may already run
- Professional installation with clean cabling means fewer support calls down the road
- Power protection keeps you online through the momentary outages that are common in office buildings
