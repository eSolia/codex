**Secure DNS:** All internet traffic from company devices routes through
Cloudflare's network, blocking malicious websites, malware downloads, and
phishing sites before they can cause harm.

**Secure Website:** A professional marketing website hosted on Cloudflare
Pages, protected by their web application firewall and DDoS protection.
Fast, secure, and globally distributed.

**Secure Access:** Every PC and mobile device connects through an encrypted
tunnel, protecting your team whether they're in the office, at home, or on
client sites—without the complexity or cost of traditional methods.

What this means for you: **enterprise-grade network security without buying
equipment.** No firewall appliances to maintain, no network expertise required.
Your team simply enables "WARP" on their device, and they're protected. It
works the same whether they're at their desk or working from a coffee shop.
