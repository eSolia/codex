## Billing Model

### Time and Materials

Our agreements are time-and-materials based with transparent pricing:

| **Increments** | 15-minute increments beyond minimum |
| **Administration fee** | Monthly fixed fee for account management |
| **Travel fees** | Per-visit fee for onsite work (varies by location) |

### Rate Options

Greater commitment means better rates:

- **Reserved Hours** — Regular monthly commitment at preferred rates
- **Pool Blocks** — Pre-paid time blocks (12-month validity)
- **Multi-year Term** — Reduced rates for longer commitment periods

### Payment Terms
