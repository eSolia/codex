## Agreement Structure

### Contract Format

Our engagements use a **Master Services Agreement (MSA)** and **Statement of Work (SoW)** structure:

- **MSA** — Basic terms covering confidentiality, liability, and general conditions
- **SoW** — Specific scope, services, and pricing for each engagement

This separation allows flexibility to add services without renegotiating base terms.

### Key Terms

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Term** | Initial term with auto-renewal options |
| **Termination** | Notice period for either party |
| **Liability** | Reasonable limitations |
| **Confidentiality** | Mutual NDA provisions |
| **IP** | Work product ownership |
