## Introduction

eSolia is a Tokyo-based B2B IT professional services firm. Since 1999, we have provided bilingual IT support to international companies operating in Japan, functioning as their local IT department with the same skills and expertise as a dedicated in-house team.

**What sets us apart:**

- **Team-based approach** — We never dispatch single engineers. Our team provides comprehensive coverage across helpdesk, infrastructure, security, and project management.
- **Bilingual professionals** — Native-level English and Japanese communication, bridging headquarters and Japan operations seamlessly.
- **25+ years of experience** — Established operational processes, thorough documentation, and proven track record with multinational clients.
- **Vendor neutral** — We recommend solutions based purely on your needs, not vendor relationships.

We focus on solving your problems, not just providing IT services. Our mission is to deliver practical, durable solutions while maintaining the highest standards of professionalism and confidentiality.

Thank you for the opportunity to present this proposal.
