## Agreement Structure

### Contract Format

eSolia uses a **Master Services Agreement (MSA)** and **Statement of Work (SoW)** structure:

- **MSA** — Basic terms covering confidentiality, liability, and general conditions
- **SoW** — Specific scope, services, and pricing for each engagement

### Billing Model

Our agreements are time-and-materials based with transparent pricing:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Minimum billing** | 1 hour minimum per visit |
| **Increments** | 15-minute increments beyond minimum |
| **Administration fee** | Monthly fixed fee for account management |
| **Callout fee** | Per-visit fee for onsite work (Tokyo 23 wards) |

### Rate Options

Greater commitment means better rates:

- **Reserved Hours** — Regular monthly commitment
- **Pool Blocks** — Pre-paid time (12-month validity)
- **Multi-year Term** — Reduced rates for longer commitment
