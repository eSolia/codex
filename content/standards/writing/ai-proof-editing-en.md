## Purpose

This guide helps eSolia team members identify and eliminate patterns that make written content sound AI-generated. Whether you're drafting proposals, client emails, technical documentation, or blog posts, use this as a checklist to ensure your writing reads as distinctly human.

Think of AI prose as a perfectly machined surface — smooth, uniform, and lifeless. Human writing is hand-finished wood: the grain, the slight imperfections, and the occasional knot are what make it feel real. This guide teaches you to restore that grain.

## How to use this guide

Use this document in two ways:

1. **As a writing checklist.** Before finalizing any client-facing or published content, scan for the patterns listed below and revise accordingly.
2. **As an editing reference.** When reviewing a colleague's draft (or your own AI-assisted draft), use the detection patterns to flag sections that need humanizing.

## Detection: vocabulary red flags

Certain words and phrases appear with unnatural frequency in AI-generated text. Individually they're fine — the problem is density. If three or more appear in a single paragraph, rewrite.

### Overused single words

| Avoid or use sparingly                    | Why it's a red flag                                             |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| delve, navigate (metaphorical), leverage  | AI reaches for these the way a nervous speaker reaches for "um" |
| robust, streamline, holistic, pivotal     | Vague intensifiers that add no specific meaning                 |
| tapestry, realm, landscape (metaphorical) | Dramatic framing for mundane topics                             |
| nuanced, multifaceted                     | AI hedging — implies complexity without demonstrating it        |
| foster, facilitate, harness               | Corporate filler verbs that obscure who does what               |
| keen, moreover, furthermore               | Stiff connectors that sound like a term paper                   |

### Overused phrases

| Phrase                                | What to write instead                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "It's worth noting that..."           | Just state the thing. If it's worth noting, note it.                                        |
| "It's important to note..."           | Same problem. Delete the preamble.                                                          |
| "Let's dive in / unpack this"         | Start with the content. The reader knows you're about to explain.                           |
| "Why that matters"                    | Rewrite the preceding sentence so the relevance is self-evident.                            |
| "At the end of the day"               | Cut entirely or replace with a specific conclusion.                                         |
| "In today's [X] landscape"            | Name the actual situation. "With M365 licensing changes in 2025..."                         |
| "This is a really great question"     | Answer the question.                                                                        |
| "I'm genuinely excited about"         | Show enthusiasm through specifics, not declarations of emotion.                             |
| "That said..." / "To be sure..."      | Use occasionally, but if it appears more than once per page, you're over-hedging.           |
| "Let's explore..."                    | Just explore it.                                                                            |
| "The key takeaway here is"            | If your writing is clear, the reader already knows.                                         |
| "What X actually means/costs"         | Drop "actually" — it implies the reader was wrong before. Just explain.                     |
| "Here's what..." / "Here are..."      | Delete the preamble and start with the content. "We require:" not "Here's what we require:" |
| "The reality is..." / "In reality..." | State the reality without announcing it.                                                    |
| "It's also worth mentioning..."       | Mention it, or don't. No preamble needed.                                                   |

## Detection: structural patterns

AI text follows predictable structures. Recognizing these patterns is often more reliable than spotting individual words.

### The validation sandwich

AI tends to compliment before answering. A human colleague doesn't say "What an excellent question!" before telling you the server is down — they tell you the server is down.

**AI pattern:** "That's a great question. [Answer]. I hope this helps!"

**Human pattern:** "[Answer]."

### The triple hedge

AI qualifies from every direction simultaneously: "While X is certainly true, it's also important to consider Y, though of course Z remains a factor." Real humans generally pick a lane. Have an opinion. State it. Qualify once if needed, then move on.

### Suspiciously uniform paragraphs

AI-generated text tends to produce paragraphs of nearly identical length — each one a tidy 3–4 sentences. Human writing is uneven. Some paragraphs are a single punchy sentence. Others sprawl a bit. Vary your paragraph length deliberately.

### The bookend compulsion

AI wraps everything in an introduction and conclusion, even when neither is needed. A three-paragraph email doesn't require "In conclusion, the points above demonstrate that..." Just stop when you've said what you need to say.

### False parallelism

AI constructs suspiciously balanced lists: "It enhances productivity, streamlines workflows, and fosters collaboration." Humans rarely maintain that level of syntactic symmetry naturally. If your list items all follow identical grammatical structure and are roughly the same length, break the pattern intentionally.

### List addiction

AI defaults to bullet points the way a drowning person grabs anything floating. Before reaching for a list, ask: would this read better as a sentence? Often the answer is yes. "Our priorities are speed, cost control, and client retention" beats a three-item bullet list.

---

## Detection: tonal red flags

### The emotional uncanny valley

AI performs emotions rather than expressing them. Watch for declarations of feeling that aren't backed by specifics:

- "I'm really passionate about this" (about what, specifically?)
- "This is fascinating" (what makes it fascinating?)
- "I truly believe" (the word "truly" is doing all the work here)

### Over-politeness

Excessive courtesy markers — "I'd be happy to help with that!", "Thank you for sharing!", "Great point!" — create a customer-service-bot feel. In professional writing, be direct and warm without being performative.

### Signposting overkill

AI narrates its own actions: "Let me explain," "Here's the thing," "Let's take a closer look at." This is the written equivalent of someone saying "I'm going to walk to the door now" while walking to the door. Just do the thing.

The "Here's" family is especially persistent — "Here's what we found," "Here's a breakdown," "Here are the common structures." These survive editing passes because they feel conversational, but they're verbal tics, not content. Delete the signpost and start with the substance.

Similarly, "What X actually means" (or "actually costs," "actually looks like") is an AI framing device. It positions the writer as revealing hidden truth. Drop "actually" entirely, or rewrite the heading to describe the content directly: "Translation vs. Localization" rather than "What Localization Actually Means."

## Revision techniques

### Inject specificity

The fastest way to humanize any sentence is to replace an abstraction with a concrete detail.

**Before (AI-sounding):** "This solution streamlines your operational workflows and enhances productivity."

**After (human):** "This cuts invoice processing from 3 days to 4 hours."

Specifics are kryptonite to AI-sounding prose because they require knowledge the model doesn't have about your actual situation.

### Vary sentence rhythm

AI tends toward medium-length sentences with consistent cadence. Break this deliberately.

Short sentences hit hard. Longer sentences can meander a bit, pick up a subordinate clause, and land somewhere slightly unexpected — and that's fine. Alternate between the two. Read your draft aloud; if it has a metronomic quality, restructure.

### Have an opinion

AI hedges because it's trained to be safe. You're not. If you think the client should consolidate their tenants, say so. "We recommend consolidating to a single tenant" is stronger than "There are several approaches worth considering, each with its own merits."

You can acknowledge trade-offs without surrendering your position.

### Use contractions

"We're" instead of "we are." "It's" instead of "it is." "Don't" instead of "do not." Contractions are a simple, reliable marker of human writing. AI uses them inconsistently; humans use them almost always in anything less formal than a legal contract.

### Break minor grammar rules on purpose

Start a sentence with "But" or "And." Use a sentence fragment for emphasis. End a sentence with a preposition if it sounds natural. These micro-violations of textbook grammar are exactly how real people write, and their absence is a tell.

### Delete your throat-clearing

Go through your draft and delete the first sentence of every paragraph. If the paragraph still makes sense (and it usually does), the first sentence was throat-clearing. This single technique eliminates a huge percentage of AI-sounding preamble.

### Cut the outro

If your final paragraph starts with "In summary," "In conclusion," "Overall," or "To wrap up" — delete it. If your document is clear, the reader doesn't need you to restate what they just read. End on your last substantive point.

## Quick-reference checklist

Use this before sending any client-facing or published document:

- [ ] No more than two words from the "overused" vocabulary table per paragraph
- [ ] No validation sandwiches ("Great question!" → answer → "Hope this helps!")
- [ ] No triple hedges — one qualification per claim maximum
- [ ] Paragraph lengths vary (some short, some longer)
- [ ] At least one concrete, specific detail per major point
- [ ] Contractions used naturally throughout
- [ ] No unnecessary introduction or conclusion paragraphs
- [ ] Lists used only when genuinely clearer than prose
- [ ] Sentences vary in length — mix short and long deliberately
- [ ] No "Here's what/Here are" or "What X actually means" signposting
- [ ] Read aloud: does it sound like something a real person at eSolia would say?

## A note on using AI as a writing tool

This guide isn't anti-AI. Using Claude or other tools to draft, brainstorm, or restructure is efficient and encouraged. The point is that AI-generated text is a _starting point_, not a finished product — the same way you wouldn't ship a first draft of anything without revision.

The revision pass is where your expertise, your opinions, and your knowledge of the client's specific situation turn generic output into something distinctly eSolia. That's the part no model can do for you.
