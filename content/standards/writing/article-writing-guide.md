# eSolia Article Writing Guide

Guide for creating engaging, narrative-driven articles for the eSolia website.

## Overview

eSolia articles focus on **practical B2B insights** drawn from real experience helping companies operate in Japan. We combine personal perspective, concrete guidance, and honest assessment. The goal: demystify complex business topics (especially Japan-specific challenges) through storytelling rather than checklist-style reference documentation.

> **Companion guides:** Before publishing, run content through the [AI-Proof Editing Guide (EN)](WRITING_GUIDE_AI_PROOF_EDITING_EN.md) and [AI-Proof Editing Guide (JA)](WRITING_GUIDE_AI_PROOF_EDITING_JA.md) checklists. For bilingual content, see the [Content Localization Strategy](CONTENT_LOCALIZATION_STRATEGY.md).

## Common Article Structure Frameworks

### 1. The Inverted Pyramid (Journalism Standard)

- Most important info first
- Supporting details
- Background context
- **Best for:** News, announcements, informational content

### 2. The Hero's Journey (Narrative Storytelling)

- Problem/challenge
- Journey/struggle
- Resolution/transformation
- **Best for:** Case studies, personal stories, transformation narratives

### 3. AIDA (Marketing/Persuasive Writing)

- **Attention** (hook)
- **Interest** (engage)
- **Desire** (benefits)
- **Action** (CTA)
- **Best for:** Product launches, service promotions, conversion-focused content

### 4. Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS)

- Identify the problem
- Agitate (make it feel urgent)
- Present solution
- **Best for:** Pain point-focused content, service positioning

### 5. The Feature-Driven Approach (Content Marketing)

- Hook
- Context/background
- Main content (often numbered sections)
- Takeaways/summary
- Call-to-action
- **Best for:** Listicles, how-to guides, in-depth guides

## The eSolia Article Framework

Based on Ann Handley's "Everybody Writes" principles and B2B content marketing best practices, adapted for eSolia's unique voice and audience.

### Core Principles

1. **Personal Perspective** - Ground articles in real experience (Rick's 35+ years in Japan)
2. **Practical Insights** - Always actionable, never purely theoretical
3. **Evidence & Examples** - Concrete stories, not abstract generalizations
4. **Clear Structure** - Scannable headers, visual breaks, logical flow
5. **Honest Assessment** - Don't sugarcoat; acknowledge challenges and nuances
6. **Demystification** - Explain the "why" behind practices, not just the "what"

### Recommended Structure

> **Warning:** These sections are a toolkit, not a template. Don't use all of them in every article, and don't follow the same order every time. If you find yourself writing identical Intro → Sections → Takeaways → CTA for every piece, you're producing cookie-cutter content. Vary structure by article type.

#### 1. **Hook** (1-2 paragraphs)

- Open with a relatable problem, surprising fact, or vivid scene
- Make the reader think "Yes, I've experienced this!" or "I need to know more"
- Set the tone: authoritative but conversational

**Example:**

> "We've been waiting three weeks just to get approval for a ¥500,000 project!" The frustration is real...

#### 2. **Context & Credibility** (1-3 paragraphs)

- Establish why you're qualified to write about this
- Provide necessary background
- Frame the scope ("This article covers X, not Y")

**Example:**

> When I first arrived in Japan 35 years ago, business transactions looked very different...

#### 3. **Main Content** (Multiple sections)

- Use clear H2/H3 headers for scannability
- Mix formats: narrative paragraphs, tables, lists, images
- Each section should tell a mini-story or make a key point
- Use subheadings to guide the reader's journey

**Structure options:**

- **Chronological** - Evolution over time (documentation section)
- **Thematic** - Related concepts grouped together (ringi process)
- **Problem-Solution** - Challenge followed by approach
- **Comparison** - This vs. that (B2C vs. B2B table)

**Writing techniques:**

- Start sections with a question or challenge
- Use concrete examples and scenarios
- Include personal anecdotes where relevant
- Add visual elements (tables, figures, diagrams)
- Explain WHY not just WHAT

#### 4. **Connective Tissue**

Between sections, add transitional sentences that:

- Acknowledge what was just covered
- Preview what's coming next
- Maintain narrative flow

**Example:**

> "The ringi process explains _when_ decisions happen. But understanding _who_ you're building relationships with is equally important."

#### 5. **Closing** (optional — 1-2 sentences max)

- Only if the article needs a final synthesis that isn't obvious from the content
- Don't restate what the reader just read — trust them
- End on your last substantive point whenever possible
- If you need a CTA, make it one sentence: link to a related page or invite contact. Don't write a "Whether you need A, B, or C, we can help" paragraph.

**Example:**

> "Japan's documentation requirements didn't emerge from cultural mystique—they evolved as practical responses to real problems."

**Framework:** Hero's Journey

- Client challenge (the problem)
- The journey (our approach)
- The transformation (results)
- Lessons learned
- Hard CTA to services

### How-To/Tutorial

**Framework:** Feature-Driven

- Clear outcome promise
- Prerequisites/context
- Step-by-step with examples
- Troubleshooting/tips

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Voice & Tone

- **Authoritative but approachable** - Expert without being condescending
- **Conversational** - Write like you're explaining to a colleague over coffee
- **Honest** - Acknowledge complexity, don't oversimplify
- **Practical** - Focus on "so what?" and "now what?"

### Sentence Structure

- Vary sentence length for rhythm
- Use short sentences for emphasis
- Break up long paragraphs (3-5 sentences max for web)
- Use active voice primarily

### Word Choice

- Prefer simple, concrete words
- Use jargon only when necessary (and explain it)
- Include Japanese terms with romaji and kanji for authenticity
- Avoid AI-pattern filler — see the [AI-Proof Editing Guide](shared/guides/WRITING_GUIDE_AI_PROOF_EDITING_EN.md) for the full list, but the worst offenders are:
  - **Vague intensifiers:** seamless, streamline, robust, holistic, cutting-edge, best-in-class, comprehensive (when not meaning "covers everything")
  - **Metaphorical hand-waving:** landscape, navigate (metaphorical), journey, realm, tapestry
  - **Corporate filler verbs:** leverage, foster, facilitate, harness, empower, elevate
  - **Marketing fluff:** synergy, thought leadership, end-to-end (when you mean "full lifecycle")
- When tempted by these words, name the specific thing instead. "Streamline your workflows" → "Cut invoice processing from 3 days to 4 hours."

### What to Avoid

**Content anti-patterns** (these crept into service pages and had to be surgically removed):

- Bullet-point reference lists where prose would be more natural
- Cookie-cutter sections: same Bold-heading + 4-bullet structure repeated N times
- False parallelism: suspiciously balanced lists where every item has the same length and grammar
- Validation sandwiches: "Why Our X Works" / "Unlike generic providers..." / "Our track record speaks for itself"
- Bookend CTAs: "Whether you need A, B, or C, eSolia can help" — just link to the contact page
- Restating the same claim multiple times with slightly different wording across a page

**Tone anti-patterns:**

- "Here's mysterious Japan" exoticism
- Sugarcoating or excessive validation
- Assuming the reader's beliefs without investigating
- Creating content without necessity (don't write just to write)

---

## Visual Elements

### When to Use Tables

- Comparisons (B2C vs B2B)
- Structured information that benefits from side-by-side viewing
- Data that would be too dense as prose

### When to Use Inline Figures

- Historical context (parking receipt, revenue stamps)
- Visual examples that enhance understanding
- Break up long sections of text
- Illustrate abstract concepts

### When to Use Lists

- Quick reference items (but sparingly)
- Steps in a process (when narrative doesn't fit)
- Multiple examples of same concept

---

## Editorial Process

### Before Writing

1. Define the article's purpose (inform, persuade, guide, analyze)
2. Identify the target reader and their pain points
3. Choose appropriate framework
4. Outline main sections and flow

### During Writing

1. Write the hook last (once you know what you're really saying)
2. Use the outline but allow for organic discovery
3. Add examples and anecdotes as you go
4. Mark sections that need fact-checking

### After Writing

1. Read aloud for flow and rhythm
2. Check for scannable structure (headers, breaks, visuals)
3. Verify all facts, links, and Japanese terms
4. Ensure each section connects to the next
5. Test the takeaway: "What will readers remember?"
