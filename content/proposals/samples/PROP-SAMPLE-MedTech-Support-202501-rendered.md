## eSolia Common Agreement Characteristics

Please note a few common aspects of our engagement agreements:

### Agreement Structure

eSolia agreement structure takes the **"Master Services Agreement" (MSA)** and **"Statement of Work" (SoW)** style:

- **MSA** covers all basic agreement points (terms, confidentiality, liability, etc.)
- **SoW(s)** cover support, projects, and development, as needed and appropriate

### Billing Model

eSolia agreements are largely **time and materials-style contracts**, but with an assumption of service volume:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Minimum billing** | Visits are billed at a minimum of 1 hour's labor × rate |
| **Increments** | Work beyond minimum is assessed in 15-minute increments |
| **Administration fee** | Monthly fixed fee for account management |
| **Callout fee** | Per-visit fee for onsite work within Tokyo 23 wards |

### Rate Structure

We set **base rates** in the agreement for various rate types: Senior Consultant, Consultant, Engineer, Assistant. The rates actually billed depend upon the **volume of work** a client can commit to.

### Favorable Rate Options

A greater commitment means lower rates:

1. **Reserved Hours** — Reserving visits and hours regularly per month
2. **Pool Blocks** — Pre-paid block of time (valid for 1 year, replenishable)
3. **Multi-year Term** — Committing to a multi-year contract term
4. **Sliding Scale** — Rates decrease as cumulative hours increase
