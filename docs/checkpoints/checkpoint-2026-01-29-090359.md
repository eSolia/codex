This conversation doesn't contain any meaningful technical work to summarize. The only content in the transcript is a queue operation event:

```json
{"type":"queue-operation","operation":"dequeue","timestamp":"2026-01-29T00:03:59.073Z","sessionId":"d8e095c9-98ad-4f4d-910a-fe6d5deb257a"}
```

There are no technical decisions, file modifications, problems solved, or next steps to document. This appears to be an empty or freshly started session with no prior work.

If you'd like me to create a checkpoint for a different conversation or session, please provide the actual conversation transcript with the work that was done.
