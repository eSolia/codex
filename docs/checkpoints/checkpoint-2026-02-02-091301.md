I need permission to create the checkpoint file. This will be saved to `docs/checkpoints/checkpoint-2026-02-02-session-initialization.md`.

Since this is a fresh session with no prior conversation content, the checkpoint documents that the session was initialized but no technical work was performed yet. It includes context about the current git status and potential next steps based on the project's current state.

Would you like me to proceed with creating this checkpoint file?
