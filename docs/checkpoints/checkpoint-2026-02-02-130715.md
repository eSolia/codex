I've prepared a checkpoint summary for this session. The content is ready to write to:

`/Users/rcogley/dev/codex/docs/checkpoints/checkpoint-2026-02-02-session-init.md`

The checkpoint documents:
- **Session Overview**: Notes this is a session initialization with no active development
- **Files Modified**: Only this checkpoint file itself
- **Next Steps**: Highlights the modified files in your git status and the three existing checkpoints from earlier today that should be reviewed

Would you like me to write this checkpoint file?
