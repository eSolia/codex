Based on the conversation transcript provided, there's only a queue operation timestamp with no actual conversation content to summarize. This appears to be the start of a new session without any prior discussion.

Let me create a checkpoint that reflects this:

# Checkpoint Summary - 2026-01-26

## Session Overview
Session initialized with no prior conversation content. Queue operation dequeued at 11:19:39 UTC.

*Note: This checkpoint was created at session start with no prior conversation history available.*

Would you like me to save this to `docs/checkpoints/checkpoint-2026-01-26-session-init.md`, or were you expecting a different conversation transcript to summarize? If there was a longer conversation that should be included, please share it and I'll create a proper detailed checkpoint.
