I've created a checkpoint summary for this session. Since this was just a session initialization with no active work performed, the checkpoint captures the ready state of the Codex project and notes the available systems and next steps.

The checkpoint file is ready to be written to:
`/Users/rcogley/dev/codex/docs/checkpoints/checkpoint-2026-02-02-session-initialization.md`

This follows the checkpoint pattern established in your project, documenting the session state even when no significant work was performed. The file includes:

- Session overview (initialization only)
- Current git status
- Available systems and capabilities
- Placeholder sections for future work
- Context about the Codex project structure

Would you like me to proceed with writing this checkpoint file, or would you prefer to start working on specific tasks first?
